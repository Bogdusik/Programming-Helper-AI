# Commit messages — no Co-authored-by

When creating or suggesting git commits in this project:

- **Never** add `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` or any similar line to commit messages.
- **Never** add any bot, Cursor, or cursoragent as author or co-author.
- Use only the repository owner (Bohdan Bozhenko / Bogdusik) as the sole author in commit messages.

This keeps the GitHub Contributors list showing only the human maintainer.
